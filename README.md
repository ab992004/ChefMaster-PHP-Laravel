### IS333 Web-Based Information Systems | Assignment 2
**Faculty of Computers and Artificial Intelligence – Cairo University**

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a migration of the **ChefMaster** Single-Page Application (SPA) originally built in Assignment 1 into a full **Laravel MVC** architecture. It features a robust backend for recipe management, third-party API integration with Spoonacular, and automated testing, all structured according to modern PHP conventions.

## 🚀 Key Requirements Fulfilled
*   **MVC Architecture:** Recreated all features from Assignment 1 using Laravel Models, Controllers, and Blade Views.
*   **Database Management:** Migrated raw SQL schemas into **Laravel Migrations** using **SQLite** for seamless submission and portability.
*   **Validation:** Implementation of dual-layer validation:
    *   **Server-side:** Utilizing Laravel's built-in validation rules in Controllers.
    *   **Client-side:** Retaining original JavaScript validation logic.
*   **Blade Templating:** Created a Master Layout (`app.blade.php`) with reusable header and footer components.
*   **Third-Party API:** Integrated Spoonacular API with a quota-rotation system, handling errors gracefully and storing keys securely in the `.env` file.
*   **Automated Testing:** Includes at least three automated tests (Feature and Unit tests) to verify core functionality.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
*   **Framework:** Laravel 11.x
*   **Language:** PHP 8.2+
*   **Database:** SQLite (configured for submission)
*   **Frontend:** Blade Templating Engine, CSS, and JavaScript
*   **Testing:** PHPUnit / Pest
